# RViz

Note that RViz is different from Gazebo, because in RViz, the simulation don't take into account gravity, friction and other forces. Gazebo reflect better the real world. Therefore, in RViz the joint positions are exact.

Test your code on simulation before real word with **use_sim:=true**:

`roslaunch interbotix_xsarm_control xsarm_control.launch robot_model:=wx250s use_rviz:=true use_sim:=true`
